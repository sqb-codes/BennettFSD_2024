Buffer - Chunks

Streams - Flow of data
- Collection of data like array, strings
- streams are useful for large amounts of data

Why we need Streams ?
1. Memory Efficient
2. Time Efficient


Types of Streams
- Readable
  - when we want to consume the data
- Writable
  - when we want to store the data
- Duplex
  - it is both readable and writable
- Transform
  - it's basically a duplex stream that can be used to modify or transform the data
